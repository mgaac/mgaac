*In pursuit of attaining the maximally predictive world model. Current rabbit holes include geometric deep learning, statecraft, and ethnography.*

- Currently building nar_index. An attempt to gain proficiency in the more practical aspects of deep learning. In a sense, reconciling too much paper reading with something more visceral, so to speak. For some time, I have reflected on how GDL as a framework could be used for program synthesis tasks—more on this later. Yet nar_index, I believe, is the first step toward that.
  - Also, I have found MLX incredibly delightful. Never thought a Mac Mini could be capable of so much. Started working on developing custom Metal kernels for common GNN operations.
- Inspired by Fukuyama’s approach in The Origins of Political Order, I have developed an interest in studying state capacity from an anthropological/ethnographic approach. That is to say, an attempt to derive explanations for societal success and/or failure in terms of the interplay between institutions and innate—so to speak—human cultural tendencies. Still thinking about this, but perhaps will release a proto-essay post soon.
