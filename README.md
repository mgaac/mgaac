*In pursuit of a maximally predictive world model. Current rabbit holes include algorithmic reasoning, invariance theory as applied to DL, and political philosophy.*

June 25
- Working as an ML-inclined Software Engineer at SPRC, building MCP servers, orchestrating agents, and hopefully making the organization more LLM-legible. More precisely:
  - Building an MCP server enabling communication between internal container management services (as in container ships) and distinct LLM-based applications.
  - Developing a Spring AI-based anomaly detection platform. Deploying multiple agents for inspection, debugging, and verification tasks for all company records.
- Continuing to build [narindex](https://github.com/mgaac/narindex/tree/main): an attempt to gain proficiency in the practical aspects of deep learning, in a sense reconciling too much paper reading with something more visceral.
  - Completing the implementation of [Neural Execution of Graph Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10593).
  - Beginning to work on a modified implementation of [G-Counterfacutal Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10105).
- Self-studying analysis. Currently, I struggle with the more theoretical results in DL, especially regarding universal approximation theorems and reasoning through concepts like the Neural Tangent Kernel.
  - Working through Understanding Analysis by Stephen Abbott.
  - Certain chapters from The Road to Reality by Penrose have proven quite useful in developing the more satisfying type of intuitions, though finishing the book entirely still seems intractable.
- Enrolled in STAT-350 and MA-261 at Purdue. Pushing through pre-reqs so that perhaps by fall I can hopefully begin working on research.
